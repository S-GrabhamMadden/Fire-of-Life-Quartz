title: The Fire of Life - Home
---
 Thousands of years ago, the [[True Gods]] breathed the [[Fire of Life]] into the world, and called it [[Aqn]]. Over time, the interest of the True Gods would fade, and from the resulting chaos arose an era of abject tyranny under the rule of the [[Djinn]]. Spirits of vast cosmic power, granted deed to ultimate authority by the [[Tablet of Destinies]], the Djinn enslaved the mortal peoples of the world. [[Pari]], benevolent spirits of the north, taught mortals the secrets of magic at the [[House of Wisdom]], and in time the mortal sorcerers would cast down the Djinn. Imprisoning their former masters and shattering the Tablet of Destinies, mortals seized control of their own fate.

A vast [[Mortal Empire|Caliphate]] is now seated at the center of the world, governed by masters of the arcane arts. Its own history has grown ancient, and threats new and old have emerged to press on the borders, physical and ethereal, of the mortal domain. In this era, it is only the sacrifice of the bold few that will save the many.
