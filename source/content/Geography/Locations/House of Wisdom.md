The **House of Wisdom** is a [[High Place]], a tall cylindrical tower in the [[Mortal Empire]] located in the mountainous borderlands between [[Rukham]], [[Irgal]], and [[Tafaeat]], near the source of the [[River Aqut]] which connects to the Great City of [[Qeb]] on the coast.

It is built on the site at which the [[Pari]] first taught magic to [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]], to use in the [[War of Fate]]. The modern House of Wisdom is much grander and less secretive institution, still tightly associated with the Pari and their form of [[Sha'ir]] poetry-magic. Scholars gather from across the world here to study various subjects under the great minds of the age.
