**Tharwa** is a semi-autonomous city located on the island of [[Sawat]] within the [[Mortal Empire]]. It is a populous center of trade and arts, famed for its grand [[Lighthouse of Tharwa|Lighthouse]], its cosmopolitan population, and the wealth of its [[Five Hundred Lords of Tharwa|Five Hundred Lords]].

## History

### Early Settlement
As with much of the coast of Sawat, the site of the contemporary city of Tharwa was settled by [[Qharmians|Qharmian]] peoples from modern [[Algharbia]]. Taking advantage of the natural defensive position, a Qharmian group established a small trading community on the [[Rock of Tharwa]] some time between -1050 and -1000 TK.

This community existed largely unchanged for several hundred years. Around -720 TK, a larger community was established on the coastal promontory shielded by the Rock of Tharwa by [[Bhanwadia|Bhanwadian]] colonists, displaced by the tyranny of the [[Djinn]] in their home region, who also settled at many sites along the southern coast of the mainland Mortal Empire, most prominently at the [[Great City of Is]] which shares a distinct architectural style with Tharwa.

The Bhanwadian colony gradually encompassed and integrated the Qharmian trade settlement, establishing a bicultural urban polity. This process followed a similar trend across the island, leading to the development of various competing city-states. Tharwa's geographic advantage allowed it to be effectively immune to attacks by land, especially after significant fortification efforts were carried out, which encouraged a focus on naval efforts for defense of the city.

### War of Fate and Aftermath
Tharwa remained neutral in the early stages of the [[War of Fate]], like many cautious [[Humans|human]] populated territories outside the core of the conflict. After [[Caliph Ezim]] went personally to Tharwa to evidence the claims of his magical power against the Djinn (as well as offering various generous trade compacts to the local merchant population who controlled Tharwa's ships), most of Sawat including Tharwa itself joined his cause. The Tharwan Fleet was instrumental in defeating Djinn-loyalist navies in the [[Western Ocean]], as well as ferrying armies from the various cities of Sawat to support the mainland war effort.

Following the war, numerous exiles, [[Zouhri]], and displaced refugees made their way to Sawat along with returning soldiers, and in many cases the new families they had made. This led to a significant demographic shift and a period of social conflict across the island. Tharwa, while faced with significant political upheaval internally, was largely insulated from the inter-city conflicts across the rest of the island, and significantly increased its wealth through advantageous trade connections between Algharbia, Bhanwadia, the new Mortal Empire, and beyond.

The expansion in population and shift of wealth and political influence into the hands of a larger merchant caste also saw *de facto* leadership gradually shift from the [[Vidhatas of Tharwa|Vidhatas]], to the [[Five Hundred Lords of Tharwa]], the elective council of merchant lords and their families which would go on to dominate commerce along the coast of the [[Western Ocean]].

### Bandit Kingdom Period and Conquest
As Tharwa cemented its position in global trade, much of Sawat gradually condensed into the [[Bandit Kingdom of Sawat]] through a series of destructive wars. The city was left largely isolated by land, and as the Bandit Kingdom started amassing its own pirate fleet, sea lanes gradually grew more dangerous.

In 521 TK, in response to continued piracy and raiding along the western coast of the Mortal Empire, [[Calipha Qunnabatu]] amassed an army in order to bring Sawat to heel. Tharwa made arrangements to aid Qunnabatu, and the combined fleets of the City and the Calipha struck decisive blows to the pirate fleet. The army of the Mortal Empire disembarked peacefully at the port of Tharwa itself, as a staging ground for the invasion of the rest of the island, starting the [[Scourging of Sawat]].

While the entire island was occupied and integrated into the Empire, as a reward for Tharwa's loyalty the city was granted generous rights of self-governance, almost comparable to those of the [[Great Cities]] on the mainland. Tharwa remained separate from the [[Khedivate]] of Sawat which governs the rest of the island, answerable only to the [[Caliph]] directly.

### Recent History
With the security of trade routes restored, and the assurance of relative freedom from external taxation, great amounts of wealth quickly returned to Tharwa. The city became the indisputable trade capital of the Mortal Empire, and perhaps the world.

The Merchant Lords would go on to multiply this wealth further with investments across the Empire, in particular along the coast, where many industries and businesses (or indeed all, in some towns) are owned in part by various Tharwan families. The consolidation of so much wealth in one place has led to explosive progress in sciences and arts within the city, thanks to the patronage offered by competing Merchant Lords.

During the [[Imperial Civil War]], Sawat joined the other [[Southern Sultanates]] in supporting the claim of [[Akhadh the Silver Prince]], albeit half-heartedly and following a coup of the appointed [[Khedive]]. Tharwa, which is autonomous from the rest of the island, did not join the Southern Sultanates in explicitly declaring for Akhadh. Instead, the Five Hundred Lords opted to remain officially neutral, continuing to trade with all sides as an independent party, and serving as a go-between for negotiations. Unofficially, however, many of the Five Hundred Lords are believed to sit firmly in Akhadh's camp, and have loaned substantial sums to his cause at favourable rates.

## Geography

### Terrain
Tharwa is located at the southeastern tip of the island of [[Sawat]]. It is a long peninsula extending into the ocean, the landscape of which is dominated by the [[Rock of Tharwa]]. The Rock is a monolithic mountain presenting sheer cliff faces on the northern side, and a narrow strip of low-lying flat land on the south side that connects to the larger eastern promontory, presenting an excellent natural barrier that protects Tharwa from any land invasion.

In the northeast of the promontory past the Rock, the coastline is a headland with a significant sheer cliff facing the ocean. There are several small coves along the northern side of the peninsula with water-level beaches, but access to the city from this side is limited to long winding staircases cut into the cliffside.

On the south side, where the land is lower, the headland curves to create a large natural harbour, which has been further enclosed by stone walls. At the tip of this curve, the famous [[Lighthouse of Tharwa]] is situated.

## Politics

### Governance
The modern city of Tharwa has a complex system of local government derived from its long and multifaceted history under several distinct authorities.

#### Vidhatas
The nominal heads of the city are the [[Vidhatas of Tharwa]], a pair of co-princes, in the style of [[Bhanwadia]]. Traditionally, the Vidhatas are responsible for matters of defense and diplomacy. It is convention that one is referred to as the "War Prince", and the other the "Peace Prince", though both share official responsibility for both areas of policy.

Under the modern [[Charter of Tharwa]], the authority of the Vidhatas has been seriously eroded. Responsibilities they have retained include hosting some official functions, receiving ambassadors, ceremonial command of the city's defenses, and making appointments to several other largely ceremonial positions.

The Vidhatas are elected to serve for life, by the [[Council of the Dome]]. There is no legal way to abdicate the position, leading to several historic instances of election to the position as a form of political isolation.

#### Lord-Councils
Major changes to the laws of the city, especially to the Charter itself, are made by the [[Five Hundred Lords of Tharwa]]. Five hundred aristocratic merchant families, recorded on the [[Rainbow Tablets of Tharwa]], are each represented by a leading patriarch or matriarch. The Five Hundred Lords gather once per year, voting on various proposals and making appointments to key positions before dissolving.

The [[Great Council of Tharwa]] is made up of fifty members of the Five Hundred Lords, with staggered five-year terms. Each year, ten positions are elected. This Council elects the [[Council of the Dome]] and many magistrates of the city. The Lords elected to the Great Council are expected to remain in Tharwa throughout their term, voting on various city bylaws and other day-to-day business, and chairing the annual gatherings of the full Five Hundred Lords.

The [[Council of the Dome]] is made up of ten members, who are forbidden from also sitting on the Great Council. The Councilors are elected by the Great Council annually as their first order of business. The Council of the Dome elects the [[Vidhatas of Tharwa]] and several other major positions, and also serves as a court with jurisdiction over state security and high-level corruption. Members of the Council of the Dome are also automatic members of the [[Senate of Tharwa]].

The [[Senate of Tharwa]] is a deliberative assembly empowered to pass decrees on matters of taxation, commerce, and military affairs. The Five Hundred Lords typically elect ten members to sit on it annually, though the Great Council may propose any number of candidates for a vote. The [[Council of the Dome]], [[Sage Colleges of Tharwa|Sage Colleges]], [[Qadiyat of Tharwa|Qadiyat]], [[Masters of Tharwa|Masters]], and all former [[Vizier of Tharwa|Viziers]] are also *ex officio* members.

#### Executive and Judicial Councils
The [[Qadiyat of Tharwa]] is made up of nine [[Qadi|Qadis]], judges of the City. Collectively, they form the supreme court of Tharwa (for all matters except those under the purview of the [[Council of the Dome]]). They serve for life, replaced by lottery of the ranking Qadis of the city. As well as judicial responsibilities, the Qadiyat is also charged with the execution of wills, guardianship over orphans, and the dispensation of some endowments and public funds. Each year, three are selected by lottery to serve as the Chief Qadis.

The [[Sage Colleges of Tharwa]] are divided into three colleges of five members each. Each member serves for a term of nine years, staggered such that one of the three colleges is elected every three years, by the [[Great Council of Tharwa]]. Each College, usually comprised of experts and experienced ministers, is responsible for various executive functions of the city.

All members of the Sage Colleges are *ex officio* members of the [[Senate of Tharwa]]. When the Sage Colleges, the [[Vizier of Tharwa]], and the three leading [[Qadiyat of Tharwa|Qadis]] meet together, it is called the [[Full College of Tharwa|Full College]], the premier executive body of the City of Tharwa.
 - The College of Council sets the agenda of the [[Senate of Tharwa]] and chairs its meetings.
 - The College of Commerce oversees navigation and maritime insurance, the resolutions and operations of the [[Hirfa of Tharwa]], the combat of smuggling, and various other such responsibilities like jurisdiction over the [[Marble Funduq]].
 - The College of Commons manages the dispatch of the laws, the maintenance of wells and fountains, the organization of local defense militias, and numerous other small miscellaneous duties.

The [[Full College of Tharwa]] is comprised of the fifteen members of the [[Sage Colleges of Tharwa]], the three Chief [[Qadiyat of Tharwa|Qadis]], and the [[Vizier of Tharwa]]. It meets daily, inviting other guests as necessary. Dispatches and reports are reviewed, audiences granted, and day-to-day executive governance of the city overseen.

#### Magistracies
The [[Masters of Tharwa|Masters]] are some of the highest ranking individual magistrates of the city, with wide-ranging or particularly prestigious authority. The Masters serve four year terms, staggered, such that the [[Council of the Dome]] elects one each year.
 - The [[Master of the Port of Tharwa|Master of the Port]] is one of the most important positions in the city. Their responsibilities include oversight over all day-to-day operations at the [[Port of Tharwa]], including scheduling, ship brokering, and the collection of all duties and tariffs. Their subordinates are also responsible for the maintenance and operation of the [[Lighthouse of Tharwa]] and the [[Fleet of Tharwa]].
 - The [[Master of the Rock]] is responsible for all the city's major fortifications and defenses, and the organization of the [[Guards of the Rock]], the professional fighting force of the city.
 - The [[Master of the Keys]] is the city's treasurer, ultimately responsible for the collection, holding, and dispensation of all public funds and other valuables.
 - The [[Master of the Tablets]] is largely ceremonial, responsible for watching over the [[Rainbow Tablets of Tharwa]], and managing the very occasional alterations made to them.

The [[Sahib of Tharwa|Sahib]] is the captain of the [[Shurta of Tharwa|Shurta]], the city watch and policing force, elected once every four years by the [[Five Hundred Lords of Tharwa|Five Hundred Lords]].

The [[Arsenal of Tharwa]] is overseen by a Captain, elected by the [[Great Council of Tharwa]] for a term of ten years.

The [[Vizier of Tharwa]] is perhaps the individual with the most political authority in the modern city. They supervise the chancery and archives, keep registers of elections, appoint notaries, and keep treaties. The Vizier also drafts letters sent by the Vidhatas to foreign courts and makes appointments to the lower courts of the city. Most significantly, they chair the [[Full College of Tharwa]]. The Vizier is the only magistrate directly elected by the [[Senate of Tharwa]], for a term of two years.

The [[Procurators of the Temples]] help maintain and manage [[Temple Square (Tharwa)|Temple Square]] and its public buildings, as well as administering trust funds and distributing alms. There is no set number of Procurators, and the position is held for life. It is one of the more lucrative sinecures still appointed by the [[Vidhatas of Tharwa]].

More than two dozen other magistracies exist to carry out specific functions, such as sanitation, firefighting, and management of the public gardens. Each has a particular historic context, meaning the roles vary greatly in term length, method of appointment, and salary.
