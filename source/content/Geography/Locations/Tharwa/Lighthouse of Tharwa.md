The **Lighthouse of Tharwa**, located at the eastern edge of the port of [[Tharwa]], is believed to be the second tallest building in the modern world, taller than the [[House of Wisdom]] but shorter than the [[Quartz Palace]] in far-eastern [[Gazar]]. It is counted among the [[Wonders of Aqn]], and burns brightly for hundreds of miles.
