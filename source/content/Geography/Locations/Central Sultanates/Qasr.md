The **Qasr** is the vast fortress and palace complex of the [[Caliph]], located in the center of the [[Central Sultanates]] of the [[Mortal Empire]], at the tripoint of [[Hadid]], [[Rukham]], and [[Tar]]. It is, itself, the size of a modest city, with tens of thousands of servants, attendants, guards, bureaucrats, and administrators.

The Qasr is built around the [[Lazurite Throne]] which predates the surrounding Palace by centuries if not millennia. The core of the Qasr was built under [[Caliph Shakush]], between 118 and 192 TK. It has since undergone a number of expansions and renovations.
## Layout

The Qasr is surrounded by miles of farmland, gardens, towers, and small villages that service the palace complex. The closest part of these surroundings is called the [[Bounds of the Qasr|Bounds]], which also includes various displays of art, and the [[Ziggurat|Ziggurats]] containing the bodies of [[Caliph Shakush]], and [[Caliph Nasirpal I]].

The Bounds encircle the [[Great Curtain Wall]], a circular stone wall miles in diameter, which defines the outer boundary of the Qasr proper. Inside is a grand bailey, containing entire townships populated by loyal servants of the palace, markets, barracks, farms, and the minor palaces of high ranking guests. This is where the [[Ziggurat]] of [[Calipha Raina]] is found, as well as the [[High Place of Contemplation]] and the [[Rookery of the Qasr|Rookery]]. Arenas, theaters, and statuaries are also found here.

The next layer is the inner bailey, surrounded by the [[Ramparts of Shakush]]. Behind these massive walls is the [[High Place of Stars]] and the [[High Place of Smiting]]. The main tower of the [[Caliph's Haras]] is here, along with a house of healing, and the [[Great Temple of the Qasr|Great Temple]] which has its own walls, also enclosing various sanctuaries and the residence of the [[High Priest]].

The last main set of walls are the [[Walls of the Palaces]], tall, thick, and famously plated in [[Orichalcum]]. Behind these walls, the Grand Halls and Kitchens, Council Chambers, Labs, Libraries, and Bathhouses are found. The [[Vizier's Palace]] is here, near the Council Chambers. The [[Lazurite Throne]] itself sits at the center. Behind the Throne, the central palatial complex of the Caliph is placed (though they have numerous official residences across the whole Qasr).

The Caliph's Palaces comprise several distinct buildings, and have their own defenses. The first accessible, the [[Palace of Feathers]], typically houses the Caliph's [[Harem]]. At several points in history, the fact that the Harem control access to the inner chambers of the Caliph has gained them significant political influence. Present somewhere in the core of the Caliph's Palaces is the [[Caliph's Sanctum]], a secluded and mysterious vault where only their closest confidants are welcome.

Beneath the Qasr is a vast network of tunnels and underground chambers. Wells, cellars, basements, and servants walkways create a web. Also underground, but with tightly controlled access, are the [[Caliph's Treasury]] and the [[Dungeon of the Qasr]]. There are numerous tales of secret tunnels and passageways underground permitting access across the complex quickly, though the truth of such a matter would only be known to the Caliph and the most experienced of the servants of the Qasr.
