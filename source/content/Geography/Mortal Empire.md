The **Mortal Empire** is the premier power in modern [[Aqn]], a state forged in the [[War of Fate]] against the [[Djinn]] which now sits at the center of the world. It is, by far, the strongest and most populous realm in the world governed by mortals.

## Governance

The ultimate temporal leader of the Mortal Empire is the [[Caliph]], a steward of the [[True Gods]] who also assumes great spiritual and cosmic responsibility. The Caliph is typically supported by dozens of ministers, courtiers, and advisors, premier among them the [[High Vizier]].

The Caliph resides at the [[Qasr]], a vast, fortified, city-like palace complex at the center of the Empire, and exercises *de jure* final authority over the entire realm. However, beyond the walls of the Qasr, the vast Empire is in fact largely governed as a number of constituent parts, each semi-autonomous and each with its own leadership and political interests.

### Subdivisions

#### Sultanates
The vast majority of land in the Empire is part of one of the thirteen [[Sultanate|Sultanates]], each with its own ruling [[Sultan]], typically an inherited position.

Though unofficial, the Sultanates are typically subdivided into five greater regional groups, based on common geographic and cultural elements:

**Southern:**
* [[Ahmar]]
* [[Qatan]]
* [[Sawat]]

**Eastern:**
 * [[Musur]]
 * [[Zaefaran]]

**Northern:**
 * [[Qalea]]
 * [[Tafaeat]]
 * [[Irgal]]

**Western:**
 * [[Hanhar]]
 * [[Aswal]]

**Central:**
 * [[Hadid]]
 * [[Rukham]]
 * [[Tar]]

#### Great Cities
The [[Great Cities]] are five small territories autonomous from the Sultanates and answerable only to the Qasr. Each is a center of population and commerce, and each is tightly associated with one of the five principles of [[Maat]], the core spiritual order of the realm.

 * [[Aam]]: The Great City of Morality.
 * [[Hath]]: The Great City of Order.
 * [[Is]]: The Great City of Balance.
 * [[Qeb]]: The Great City of Harmony.
 * [[Saa]]: The Great City of Truth.
