**Marjan** is a large coral atoll, roughly 700 miles south of [[Sawat]]. Not placed on any major trade routes, the atoll has been lightly populated by various populations of fishermen throughout ancient history. As a source of coral for jewelry and other cultural uses, as well as the last major waypoint between the [[Mortal Empire]] and the [[Burkanas]], its economic base and population has grown modestly over time.

Marjan was, at one time, the southernmost outpost of the [[Bandit Kingdom of Sawat]]. Following the [[Scourging of Sawat]], the atoll escaped the ire of the [[Mortal Empire]] as a small and distant target. Marjan soon became the destination of Sawati refugees, many of whom were of [[Zouhri]] families that had been expelled from the mainland [[Mortal Empire]] to [[Sawat]] centuries before.

In the wake of the downfall of the [[Bandit Kingdom of Sawat]], a largely *ad hoc* and informal government based on strength has evolved in Marjan. The atoll is now governed by a fluctuating group of [[Vidhatas of Marjan|Vidhatas]], self-proclaimed bandit princes who collectively administer public affairs.

Piracy from Marjan and the surrounding smaller atolls is an occasional but steady problem for trade routes between the [[Mortal Empire]], [[Algharbia]], and [[Bhanwadia]]. In good weather, the atoll is a week's sailing from these routes, close enough for the small fleets of the [[Vidhatas of Marjan|Vidhatas]] to reliably travel.
