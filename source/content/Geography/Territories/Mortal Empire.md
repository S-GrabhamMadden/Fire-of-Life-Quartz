The **Mortal Empire** is the premier power in modern [[Aqn]], a state forged in the [[War of Fate]] against the [[Djinn]] which now sits at the center of the world. It is, by far, the strongest and most populous realm in the world governed by mortals.

## Politics

### Governance
The ultimate temporal leader of the Mortal Empire is the [[Caliph]], a steward of the [[True Gods]] who also assumes great spiritual and cosmic responsibility. The Caliph is typically supported by dozens of ministers, courtiers, and advisors, premier among them the [[High Vizier]].

The Caliph resides at the [[Qasr]], a vast, fortified, city-like palace complex at the center of the Empire, and exercises *de jure* final authority over the entire realm. However, beyond the walls of the Qasr, the vast Empire is in fact largely governed as a number of constituent parts, each semi-autonomous and each with its own leadership and political interests.

### Orders
The Orders of the Empire are major social and political bodies recognized by the Caliphate, empowered with certain responsibilities and granted significant autonomy and authority. 

#### Khatibi Order
The [[Khatibi]] are the organized priesthood of the Mortal Empire, the proponents of [[Al-Khatib]], and the memorialists of the great [[Wali]].

#### Magi Order
The [[Magi]] are astrologers, alchemists, and sorcerers long since divided from the teachings of the [[House of Wisdom]]. They maintain many educational [[Madrasa|Madrasas]], and serve as advisors to nearly every aristocratic court of note.

#### Fidai Order
The [[Fidai]] are a closed association of assassins and hunters, following the many predictions left behind by their mysterious founder. Officially, the Fidai are responsible for killing dangerous monsters and [[Sahir]] Black Magicians, but have also *allegedly* served historically as killers of tyrants.

## Subdivisions

### Sultanates
The vast majority of land in the Empire is part of one of the thirteen [[Sultanate|Sultanates]], each with its own ruling [[Sultan]], typically an inherited position. Several of the Sultanates have differences in political status from the norm, but all are largely autonomous in day-to-day affairs.

Though unofficial, the Sultanates are typically subdivided into five greater regional groups, based on common geographic and cultural elements:

**[[Southern Sultanates|Southern]]:**
* [[Ahmar]]
* [[Qatan]]
* [[Sawat]]

**[[Eastern Sultanates|Eastern]]:**
 * [[Musur]]
 * [[Zaefaran]]

**[[Northern Sultanates|Northern]]:**
 * [[Qalea]]
 * [[Tafaeat]]
 * [[Irgal]]

**[[Western Sultanates|Western]]:**
 * [[Hanhar]]
 * [[Aswal]]

**[[Central Sultanates|Central]]:**
 * [[Hadid]]
 * [[Rukham]]
 * [[Tar]]

### Great Cities
The [[Great Cities]] are five small territories separate from the Sultanates and answerable only to the Qasr. Each is a center of population and commerce, and each is tightly associated with one of the five principles of [[Maat]], the core spiritual order of the realm.

 * [[Great City of Aam|Aam]]: The Great City of Morality.
 * [[Great City of Hath|Hath]]: The Great City of Order.
 * [[Great City of Is|Is]]: The Great City of Balance.
 * [[Great City of Qeb|Qeb]]: The Great City of Harmony.
 * [[Great City of Saa|Saa]]: The Great City of Truth.

### Special Territories
Several other territories outside the thirteen Sultanates swear allegiance to the Mortal Empire to some degree, each a unique case politically and socially.

[[Sharaq]] is a [[Khedivate]] in the [[Eastern Frontier]], a militarized governorate that serves as a bulwark against the [[Eastern Realms]].

[[Tharwa]] is a city on the island of [[Sawat]], independent of the [[Khedive]] there. It pays modest taxes to the Caliph and is otherwise autonomous, governed by the eponymous [[Five Hundred Lords of Tharwa]].

The [[Greater Well]] and [[Lesser Well]], two large lakes entirely enclosed within the territory of the Mortal Empire, are populated by [[Buhayr Kullullu]] who have sworn various fealties and loyalties to the surrounding Sultanates as well as to the Caliph, but largely manage their own affairs.

## Peoples

The Mortal Empire is perhaps the most populous realm in the world, home to a wide variety of demographic groups.

The predominant race of the Empire are [[Humans]], who make up an absolute majority of the population, and disproportionately hold wealth and authority within government and society.

[[Kullullu]], the mortal people of the water, are much less populous in the Mortal Empire than humans, but nevertheless common in cosmopolitan areas. They are often held up as a "model minority", exoticized, and held to strict caste-like social expectations. Other than the [[Buhayr Kullullu]] of the Lakes, the [[Riverlords]] are the most notable Kullullu population, serving vital roles in the economic and social fabric of the Empire.

[[Zouhri]], [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]] of some degree of [[Beings/Spirits/index|Spiritual]] ancestry, are common in some parts of the Empire, particularly the North, but make up at most a tenth of the population overall. Zouhri face varying levels of discrimination dependent on their particular ancestry, but all face some level of suspicion and restriction, particularly with regard to any public office.

[[Beings/Spirits/index|Spirits]], intelligent [[Monsters]], and other more exotic [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortal Beings]] all inhabit the Empire, but are only integrated into society in small numbers.

## Culture

The Mortal Empire is vast and demographically diverse, but there are several shared cultural touchstones that can be identified across the great majority of its territory.

### Language
The primary language of all social function is the [[Mortal Tongue]], its different dialects holding different levels of esteem for certain contexts and establishing degrees of relative social standing. [[Kullull]], the language of the [[Kullullu]], is also spoken, particularly by the [[Buhayr Kullullu]] of the Lakes.

### Religion
[[Al-Khatib]] has been the State Religion of the Mortal Empire since the [[Apostasy]], overseen by the [[Khatibi|Khatibi Order]], the organized Church and Priesthood. This is a doctrine of ancestor worship and memorialization, empowering and calling on the souls of great Mortal [[Wali]] in defiance of any worship of a higher power.
