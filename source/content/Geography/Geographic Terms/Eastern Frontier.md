The **Eastern Frontier** refers to the region immediately to the east of the [[Mortal Empire]], dominated by the [[Merudan Mountains]] and the [[Hawaf Deserts]]. There are a number of small polities, statelets, and tribes of both [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]] and [[Beings/Spirits/index|Spirits]] (especially [[Div]]) here, but the population is sparse and disparate.

The [[Khedivate]] of [[Sharaq]], the most remote region under the influence of the [[Caliph]] is located here. It is a distant military governorate which acts as a bulwark and collects tributes from the local population.

Beyond the Eastern Frontier and south of [[Mazandaran]] is the [[Eastern Realms]], including [[Hudud]] and [[Kandaravat]].
