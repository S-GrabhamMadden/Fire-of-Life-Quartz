**Humbaba** is a [[Beings/Monsters/Greater Monsters/index|Greater Monster]], a [[Heavenly Beast]] made from the pure waters of the [[Abzu]] by the [[True Gods]]. His form is said to shift and change according to his will, but still invariably with a starry appearance, and huge in size. Incredibly powerful, Humbaba is perhaps the first of the monsters created by the True Gods, said to act as a warden or perhaps a jailer.

Humbaba is well-entrenched in the modern culture, used in tales to get children to behave almost as much as [[Iblis]].

As well as all the powers his siblings hold, such as breathing a flow of destructive celestial water, Humbaba has a further unique kind of power, in his Seven Auras.

Described allegorically like branches, the Seven Auras wrap around Humbaba as gifts of the True Gods, granting him incredible strength, and invulnerability.
