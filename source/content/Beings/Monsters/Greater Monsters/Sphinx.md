The **Sphinx** are [[Beings/Monsters/Greater Monsters/index|Greater Monsters]], with bodies of lions or bulls, wings of an eagle, and faces of man. They are seen as elder cousins, in some sense, to the spiritual [[Lamassu]], with whom they share both physical similarities as well as a propensity for protective duties.

The Sphinx were created to serve as sentinels of secret places, and enlightened companions. Only five were known to ever exist, and fewer live today.

 - The [[Green Sphinx]] once guarded the [[Khazneh el-Akhdar]] somewhere in the [[Eastern Frontier]], but perished prior to the [[Raid on the Khazneh el-Akhdar|raid]] on that place, struck down by an unknown group of [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]].
 - The [[White Sphinx]] is spoken of in some historic texts, but any detail as to their nature or location is long since lost.
 - The [[Red Sphinx]] is believed to still live, guarding the [[Khazneh el-Ahmar]] somewhere in [[Zaefaran]].
 - The [[Blue Sphinx]] is believed to still live, guarding the [[Khazneh el-Azraq]] somewhere in [[Irgal]].
 - The [[Black Sphinx]] is known to still live, guarding the [[High Place of Silence]] in [[Ahmar]].
