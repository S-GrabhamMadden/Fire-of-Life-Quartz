The **Zaratan** is a [[Beings/Monsters/Greater Monsters/index|Greater Monster]], resembling a sea turtle large enough to be mistaken for an island. They have an incredibly long lifespan, and traverse the oceans of [[Aqn]] in slow but regular migratory patterns. Some Zaratan have indeed been settled like islands by [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]], particularly the [[Rider Kullullu]], who hold long-term trade compacts with the ports they pass on their long circuit.
