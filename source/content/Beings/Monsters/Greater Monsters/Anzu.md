Anzu is a [[Beings/Monsters/Greater Monsters/index|Greater Monster]], a [[Heavenly Beast]] made from the pure waters of the [[Abzu]] by the [[True Gods]]. Alike a massive lion-headed eagle made of stars and sky, and capable of breathing a flow of destructive celestial water, Anzu, like his siblings, is among the most destructively capable of the Greater Monsters.
