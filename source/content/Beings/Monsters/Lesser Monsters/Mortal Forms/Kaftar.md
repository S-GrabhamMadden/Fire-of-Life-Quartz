The **Kaftar** is a type of [[Beings/Monsters/Lesser Monsters/index|Lesser Monster]], originally a [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortal]] who has been cursed with aspects of a hyena, becoming a hybridized beast that must subsist on the flesh of other mortals, like a [[Ghul]]. Scholars suggest some kind of relation to the shapechanging ways of the [[Sila]], which would explain their need for flesh. Some Kaftar have been known to sate their hunger by grave-robbing, but many succumb to murderous temptation.
