The **Ghul** is a type of [[Beings/Monsters/Lesser Monsters/index|Lesser Monster]] most common in evil times, when [[Maat]] is in disarray. In such times, evil can inhabit the dead bodies of [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]] whose souls have left. Generally, those who have been buried improperly are most at risk, but even deeply buried bodies can be inhabited in especially chaotic periods.

After rising, the Ghul seek to consume mortal flesh, that of both the living and the dead.
