The **Homay** is a type of [[Beings/Monsters/Lesser Monsters/index|Lesser Monster]], a bird, falcon-like in appearance and size. It is said to have both male and female natures in one body, each having one wing. It has no legs, and so never lands on the ground, spending its entire life flying.

A "bird of fortune" like the [[Simurgh]], its shadow or touch is seen as auspicious. Its sightings are believed to bring joy, though it is also believed that the Homay cannot be caught alive, and that the person who kills one will die in forty days.

Homay are found in many places of [[Aqn]]. They are most common, perhaps, in [[Paristan]]. In the realms of [[Hudud]] beyond the [[Eastern Frontier]], the shadow of the Homay is said to bestow or foretell kingship.
