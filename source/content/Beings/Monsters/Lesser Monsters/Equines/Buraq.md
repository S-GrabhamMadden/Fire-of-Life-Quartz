The [[Buraq]] is a type of [[Beings/Monsters/Lesser Monsters/index|Lesser Monster]]. A small winged equine native to [[Paristan]], it is notable for its radiant appearance and lightning-like speed. Incredibly difficult to catch or tame, they have been used occasionally as mounts by the [[Pari]] and others.
