The **Shabdiz** is an equine [[Beings/Monsters/Lesser Monsters/index|Lesser Monster]]. Described as "night-coloured" in appearance, the Shabdiz is renowned as the fastest horse in the world, even more-so than the [[Buraq]], though without the utility of flight. Very rare and notoriously hard to breed, the Shabdiz is prized for use with couriers. The [[Sipahi of Tar]] are a cavalry unit famed for exclusively using Shabdiz as mounts.
