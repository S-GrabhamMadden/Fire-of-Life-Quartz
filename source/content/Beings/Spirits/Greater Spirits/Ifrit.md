The **Ifrit** are powerful [[Beings/Spirits/Greater Spirits/index|Greater Spirits]], third in order of creation following the [[Marid]] and the [[Djinn]]. Uniquely, the Ifrit were granted responsibilities over [[Kur]], the underworld which dead mortal souls return to, which left them greatly removed from the events of the [[War of Fate]] and the continuing conflicts between [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]] and [[Beings/Spirits/index|Spirits]] above ground. This allowed most of the Ifrit to maintain their powerbase up to the modern era, still free and in positions of power unlike the [[Djinn]] and individually much more powerful than their youngest cousins, the [[Pari]].

The Ifrit (with a handful of exceptions) are largely removed from surface politics outside maintaining their domains of influence, and policing the natural laws that fall on the souls of the dead.

## Involvement in the [[Imperial Civil War]]

In 1311 TK the Ifrit Gatekeeper [[Pazuzu]], and his Ifrit allies, were revealed to have been influencing and dealing with [[Caliph Alsaqr]], granting aid and promising him eternal rulership over the mortal dead in exchange for him extinguishing the [[Fire of Life]]. This plot was foiled by the [[Lanternbearers]], and greatly discredited the cause of the Caliph's loyalists as news spread across the [[Mortal Empire]].

The aftermath led to the crumbling of Pazuzu's network of influence on the surface, and a half-hearted siege of [[Pazuzu's Gate]], but the Ifrit Gatekeeper remained secure in his seat of power, rebuilding forces, doubtless devising new schemes against Mortal and Spirit alike to play out over the next centuries.

## Gatekeepers

Four of the most powerful Ifrit of the west held the title of [[Gatekeeper]], over the [[Gates to Kur]], though one was destroyed during the [[War of Fate]]. An equivalent eastern set of four further [[Eastern Gates to Kur|Gates]] is known to exist from the accounts of sailors and merchants of the far east, but the names and deeds of the Keepers of these Gates are unfamiliar in the west. The four Western Keepers are:

* [[Pazuzu]]: Son of [[Hanbi]], Gatekeeper of [[Pazuzu's Gate]] in the East, Envoy of [[Kur]] to the Surface World.
* [[Namtar]]: High Steward, Gatekeeper of [[Namtar's Gate]] in the South, crafter of diseases.
* [[Kilili]]: High Chancellor, Gatekeeper of [[Kilili's Gate]] in the North, mistress of owls, windows, and whispers.
* [[Shamal]]: Formerly High Marshal and Gatekeeper of [[Shamal's Gate]] in the West. Slain during the [[War of Fate]] while leading a contingent of Ifrit in support of the [[Djinn]].

## Other Notable Ifrit

 * [[Hanbi]]: [[Padšar]] of the Ifrit.
 * [[Kigal]]: [[Padšar|Padšarina]] of the Ifrit.
