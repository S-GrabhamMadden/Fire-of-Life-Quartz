The **Pari** were the fourth amongst the [[Beings/Spirits/Greater Spirits/index|Greater Spirits]], youngest of the high ranking stewards of creation. The Pari are individually less powerful than [[Djinn]] or [[Ifrit]], but much more numerous and capable of cooperation. Though their forms vary, they commonly appear as tall and beautiful winged figures. They are commonly considered the most kind and helpful of spirits by mortal kind, but the Pari can be prone to their own long-lasting grudges and incredibly destructive tantrums.

Artists and magicians, the Pari taught magic to mortals at the [[House of Wisdom]] to empower their rebellion against the Djinn, cementing a positive relationship between the Pari and the newborn [[Mortal Empire]]. Some Pari, and their [[Zouhri]], live amongst that Empire today as scholars and teachers, but the majority reside in their own country, [[Paristan]], located to the north of the Mortal Empire beyond the [[Qaf Mountains]].
