The **Djinn** are among the most powerful [[Beings/Spirits/Greater Spirits/index|Greater Spirits]], second children of the [[True Gods]] only to the rebellious [[Marid]]. They governed the world for centuries after the passage of the True Gods, with [[Supreme Cosmic Authority]] granted to them through the position of [[Caliph]], inscribed in the [[Tablet of Destinies]]. They have since been overthrown, locked away in various secret prisons for their horrific tyranny.
