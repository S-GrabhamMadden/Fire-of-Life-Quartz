The **Qareen**, meaning *Constant Companion*, are a race of [[Beings/Spirits/Lesser Spirits/index|Lesser Spirits]], kin to the [[Zar]]. These Spirits spawn without any sense of identity, and tend to fixate on and double individual [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]] of interest. Young Qareen are dangerously impressionable. Older ones, more settled into an identity, can range from guardian to haunting presence.
