The **Udug** are a race of [[Beings/Spirits/Lesser Spirits/index|Lesser Spirits]]. Chthonic beings of impenetrable shadow, poisoned claws, and deafening voices. Contrary to popular belief, the Udug are not exclusively malevolent, and serve as capable protectors of places or people. Mostly, however, the Udug are subservient to the [[Ifrit]], who rule over their native [[Kur]].
