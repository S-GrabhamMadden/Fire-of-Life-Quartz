The **Udgalla** are a race of [[Beings/Spirits/Lesser Spirits/index|Lesser Spirits]]. Large beings, typically seen with the heads of lions and the talons of eagles, who travel with and inhabit storms. The Udgalla are generally seen to intervene only in moments of disaster. Historically, the Udgalla were servants and agents of the [[Djinn]], but after the downfall of their masters the Udgalla have scattered and grown rare.
