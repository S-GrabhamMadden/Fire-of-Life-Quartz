The **Shayatin** are a mysterious race of [[Beings/Spirits/Lesser Spirits/index|Lesser Spirits]]. Often associated with the [[Marid]], the Shayatin are believed to be their creation, which would make them one of the oldest forms of spirit in the world. The Shayatin are wickedly intelligent, masters of ancient sorcery, and rumoured to retain some access to and from the lost land of [[Erum]]. They have been known to share some of their secret knowledge with [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]] or other [[Beings/Spirits/index|Spirits]], but are generally regarded as evil influences, responsible for calamities.

When present on [[Aqn]], the Shayatin are generally invisible, present only on the [[Spirit Winds]] akin to the [[Zar]]. When called directly, or on rare occasions voluntarily, the Shayatin will reveal itself materially. They are said to be horned and barbed, and grotesque in form.
