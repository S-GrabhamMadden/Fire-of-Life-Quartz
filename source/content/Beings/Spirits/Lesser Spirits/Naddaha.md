The **Naddaha** are a race of [[Beings/Spirits/Lesser Spirits/index|Lesser Spirits]], created by the [[Djinn]] [[Aicha Qandisa]]. These siren spirits often dwell near rivers and other waterways, drawing in and subduing mortal fools before utterly destroying them. At other times, particularly when the Naddaha's needs are otherwise met, the spirit can form a symbiotic relationship with nearby communities, and protect a valuable source of potable water from sabotage.
