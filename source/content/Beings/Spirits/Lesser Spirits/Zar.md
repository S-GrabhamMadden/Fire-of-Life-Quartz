The **Zar** are a race of [[Beings/Spirits/Lesser Spirits/index|Lesser Spirits]]. Often hostile, or at least easily offended, these invisible spirits possess, inhabit, and "wear" [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortal]] bodies. Kin of the [[Qareen]], the Zar have a partially symbiotic relationship with mortal folk and can be reasoned with. Some small cults of mystics intentionally welcome in groups of Zar and form relationships and agreements with them, called [[Eibadat Zar]].
