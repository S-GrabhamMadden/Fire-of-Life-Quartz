Translating to *Lingerer* in the [[First Tongue]], the **Rabisu** are controversially described as a form of [[Beings/Spirits/Lesser Spirits/index|Lesser Spirits]], for their ultimately [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortal]] origin.

Rabisu are the souls of mortals that have failed, for whatever reason, to reach the underworld. Far from the embrace of [[Aqn]], they must sustain themselves with the life force of others or fade from existence. The vast majority will fall under the dominion of an [[Ifrit]], the lords of death and the underworld, to serve as collectors of the souls of others.
