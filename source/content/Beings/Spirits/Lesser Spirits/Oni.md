The **Oni** are a race of [[Beings/Spirits/Lesser Spirits/index|Lesser Spirits]]. Monstrously powerful [[Corporeal Spirits]] of the far east, the Oni are the masters of the eponymous [[Onistan]]. Supposedly capable of shapeshifting, controlling thunder and lightning, incredible feats of strength, and other kinds of spiritual magic, the Oni are among the most potent of the Lesser Spirits.

Though their true origin is now shrouded in mystery, the leading theory among scholars of the [[Mortal Empire]] is that the Oni are a synthesis of [[Djinn]] and [[Div]], akin to the [[Zouhri]] produced with [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]].
