The **Haoma Tree** is a rare plant with magical properties, most typically found in areas of lush growth. It is most common on the [[Lasashi Pranta]], but is not exclusive to that part of the world.

The Haoma is tall and fragrant, its leaves described as "golden-green". Haoma products are associated with various medicinal benefits:
 - Tea made with its leaves is said to further healing and awareness.
 - Its bark may be used as a harmless and mild intoxicant and aphrodisiac.
 - Its sap is nourishing and physically strengthening.
 - Its fruits are said to cure various minor ailments outright.

The Haoma Tree has many spiritual and divine associations. The [[Gaokerena]], a vast tree of the [[Abzu]] from where fertility and seeds come to [[Aqn]], is said to be a massive Haoma Tree. [[Simurgh]], great birds of the [[Gaokerena]], typically nest in Haoma Trees when they are present in [[Aqn]].
