The **True Gods** were the mysterious creators of [[Aqn]] and all its inhabitants, and even the numerous [[Geography/Celestial Bodies/index|Celestial Bodies]] visible in the sky. Their deeds are detailed and remembered in the ancient [[Epic of Dawn]]. The True Gods left the world behind over two thousand years ago, inscribing the [[Tablet of Destinies]] to enshrine fates for all things to come, and leaving stewardship of creation to the [[Djinn]].
