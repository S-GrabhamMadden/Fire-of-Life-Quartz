**Kullullu** are the most common sapient mortals of the water, created from the [[Fire of Life]] at the same time as [[Humans]]. They are divided into numerous cultures and subgroups, but have several uniting factors, such as the shared [[Kullull]] language.

## Kullullu Cultures

### Buhayr
[[Buhayr Kullullu]] are the settlers of the interior lakes of the [[Mortal Empire]], the [[Greater Well]] and the [[Lesser Well]]. They reside both in traditional underwater cities at the base of the lakes, as well as floating townships which are cohabitated with Humans. The Buhayr have adopted a form of [[Al-Khatib]], the ancestor worship common in the Mortal Empire.

### Riverlords
The [[Riverlords]] are a largely-nomadic culture which traverse the [[Waterways of the Mortal Empire]] and beyond, as merchants, ferrymen, and travelling performers. Some have settled in the port cities as facilitators, but most ply their trade on proud riverboats.

### Muhit
[[Muhit Kullullu]] are the inhabitants of the ocean floor, which have retained a separate tradition and lifestyle from those that have integrated with Humans in the Mortal Empire and beyond.

[[Shaiti Kullullu]] are the Muhit of the coasts and beaches, cousins of the Buhayr and a bridge in trade and communications between those of the land and those of the oceans.

[[Amuru Kullullu]] are the Muhit of the [[Western Ocean]], divided into a number of small polities.

[[Sumir Kullullu]] are the Muhit of the [[Southern Ocean]], united under the [[Urkara]] with a reputation for hostility towards outsiders.

### Riders
[[Rider Kullullu]] are those that inhabit the backs of great wandering [[Zaratan]], like slow-moving islands that take their inhabitants on sluggish courses around the oceans of the world.
