**Zouhri** are the progeny of [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]] and [[Beings/Spirits/index|Spirits]], mortals with the blood of [[Pari]], [[Djinn]], [[Div]], or any number of other Spirit. Some small amount of such ancestry is not especially rare, but closely related Zouhri are uncommon in the modern [[Mortal Empire]], and face a number of social restrictions, especially the children of the [[Djinn]].
