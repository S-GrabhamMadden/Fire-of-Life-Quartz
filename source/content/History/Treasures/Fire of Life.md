The **Fire of Life** was breathed into [[Aqn]] by the [[True Gods]] at the dawn of time to give heat to the world. All [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortals]], including natural beasts, originate from the spawn of the divine fire, slowly emerging from tunnels in the earth to join the surface world which was previously populated majorly by [[Beings/Spirits/index|Spirits]]. Should the fire ever be extinguished entirely, all mortal life would end in that instant.

## Recent History
The Fire of Life has an intrinsic connection to [[Maat]] and the general spiritual health of mortality. In recent centuries, particularly following the expulsion of the [[Pari]] maintainers during the reign of [[Caliph|Calipha]] [[Raina]], and accelerated in the disastrous later years of the reign of Caliph [[Alsaqr]], the Fire gradually dimmed to the point of being housed in a single magic lantern, hidden away for safety.

In [[Timeline|1311 TK]], in the midst of the [[Imperial Civil War]] a [[Lanternbearers|small group of heroes]] were brought to the [[Mer of the Ibis]], a [[High Place]] of eastern [[Musur]], the secret hiding place of the last spark of the Fire of Life. It's few remaining guardians had divined an approaching threat, and had foreseen that gathering these individuals in the right place at the right time could create a chance for the survival of the Fire.

The Mer of the Ibis was soon attacked by the [[Caliph's Haras|Haras]] of Caliph Alsaqr, setting the Lanternbearers on their journey across the [[Mortal Empire]] and the [[Kur|Underworld]] to escort the flame to safety. This journey culminated in the relighting of the [[God's Brazier]] deep under the earth, in which the Fire greatly multiplied in size. It is now sure to burn on for many generations.
