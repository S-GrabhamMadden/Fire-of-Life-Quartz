The **Tablet of Destinies** was a massive slab of [[Lazurite]], carved by the [[True Gods]] just prior to their [[Passage of the True Gods|Passage]], which inscribed in stone the fate of all things as well as granting [[Supreme Cosmic Authority]] to the Djinn as stewards of creationâ€”making [[Sakhr]] the first [[Caliph]].

At the conclusion of the [[War of Fate]], the Tablet of Destinies was shattered by [[Beings/Mortals/index|Mortal]] sorcerers, the shards ground into powder, and the powder scattered across the desert sands, in order to deny Cosmic Authority to Sakhr and free Mortal kind from their ossified fates.

## Shards of Destiny
A handful of shards of the Tablet of Destinies are known to have been secreted away undestroyed, said to contain a powerful sliver of the Tablet's command over fate. Slowly squandered on various troubles of the day, very few exist in the modern age.

Known Shards include:
* Two which were known to exist in the [[Caliph|Caliph's]] treasury at the [[Qasr]], though the status of the treasury following the demise of [[Caliph Alsaqr]] is unclear.
* One remaining in the possession of the [[Magi Order]], hidden at a secret location only known to the highest ranking members of the Order.
* Another known to have been held in the treasury of the [[Green Sphinx]], but which vanished in the aftermath of the [[Raid on the Khazneh el-Akhdar]].
