The **Mortal Tongue** is the main language of conversation at all levels and contexts in the [[Mortal Empire]]. It is the modern evolution of the ancient [[First Tongue]], significantly changed over the millennia by natural linguistic shift and the incorporation of loan-words from various spiritual tongues.

# Dialects
While largely mutually intelligible across the entire span of the Empire, the Mortal Tongue does comprise a number of distinct dialects, each of which has its quirks and cultural associations. Although there is no strict caste system in the Empire, one's native dialect is often a marker of social status.

 * [[Low Tongue]]: The dialect of the servant classes, city-dwellers, and [[Zouhri]].
 * [[Silver Tongue]]: The dialect of merchants, sailors, and foreign travelers.
 * [[Blue Tongue]]: The dialect of priests, aristocrats, and farmers.
