**Taqwim hasb Karama**, often shortened to **TK**, is the *Calendar according to Karama*, referencing [[Calipha Karama]] who led an effort to establish a new calendar, the epoch of which was the dawn of the [[Mortal Empire]] at the conclusion of the [[War of Fate]], marked specifically by the crowning of [[Caliph Ezim]].

The calendar is based on traditional [[Qamar|Qamari]] calendars, restructured to achieve a more holy arrangement according to the ideals of [[Al-Khatib]], the pseudoreligious creed of the [[Khatibi Order]] to which [[Calipha Karama]] belonged, and which would soon become predominant across the [[Mortal Empire]].

The year has ten months, each beginning on the day when a new crescent [[Qamar]] may be sighted in the skyâ€”meaning there is not a set number of days in a month. Each month is typically between 30-40 days long. 

Because the Qamari months are not perfectly aligned with the Thronical Year, the seasons drift over time. Occasionally, every few years, an additional month must be inserted, to keep the years in broad alignment over time. This is decided by the [[Heirophant]] of the [[Earafi School]], who determines both the placement and particular significances of the additional month, based on interpretations of the current state of [[Maat]] and the health of the realm.

## Weeks & Days

Each day ends, and the next so begins, at the setting of the [[Throne]]. There is no formal definition of a week in the **Taqwim hasb Karama** as defined, except for that each sixth day will be [[Yawm Raha]], the *day of rest*. This count of days spills over between months and indeed years. In informal and civil usage, the preceding five days are referred to numerically:

| Day           | Meaning    |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Yawm Awal     | First Day  |
| Yawm Thaani   | Second Day |
| Yawm Thaalith | Third Day  |
| Yawm Raabie   | Fourth Day |
| Yawm Khamis   | Fifth Day  |
| [[Yawm Raha]] | Rest Day   |
