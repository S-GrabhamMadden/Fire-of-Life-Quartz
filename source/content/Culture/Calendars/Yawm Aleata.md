**Yawm Aleata** is a holiday in the [[Taqwim hasb Karama]], which occurs on the first day of Sadaqa. It is a day of gift-giving, the forgiveness of debts, and charitable deeds.

Most debt agreements among moneylenders of the [[Mortal Empire]] will specify terms of repayment that conclude at the next **Yawm Aleata**. It is considered a holy and prestigious practice to refuse the final payment installment, typically due on that day, a practice also common to landholders collecting rents.

Many people give gifts to family members and other significant people on this day. The wealthy and noble are expected to provide charity, often in the form of donations to local temples to be distributed as alms to the poor.
