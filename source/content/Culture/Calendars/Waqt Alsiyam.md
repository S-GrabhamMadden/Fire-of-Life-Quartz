**Waqt Alsiyam** is a holiday period in the [[Taqwim hasb Karama]]. It is a time of fasting which lasts three days, the 11th through 13th days of Alrasana. Generally, this is the time shortly prior to the harvest period of major crops like wheat, which historically and particularly in times of famine would be the period of the year when food would be the most scarce.

While common people are only expected to avoid indulgence and waste in this period, many pious individuals go so far as to fast completely for the three day period. Some especially devout [[Khatib]], particularly of the [[Naasiqi School]], will attempt to fast through the entire month of Alrasana, refusing food entirely until the next crescent [[Qamar]] is seen. As the length of the month varies in the [[Taqwim hasb Karama]], a particularly long Alrasana is cursed by those fasting, and generally considered inauspicious.
