The **Magi** are one of the three [[Orders of the Mortal Empire]]. Their numbers count astrologers, alchemists, various arcane practitioners, and all manner of other scholar. They fill key niches as advanced educators, advisors, and skilled workers across the [[Mortal Empire]] and beyond.

## Organisation

### Leadership

The Magi are ultimately governed by a council, the [[College of the Seven Sages]]. This College meets regularly to discuss issues concerning the Order as a whole, and to foster cooperation between the various regional bodies. Each of the Seven is the [[Grand Sage]] of one of the original seven [[Madrasa|Madrasas]] of the Order.

Meetings of the Seven Sages are held at one of these Madrasas, rotating between them. Whichever of the Grand Sages is host also chairs the College for the duration of their meeting, granting them the power to set the agenda for discussion.

The College of the Seven Sages is empowered to pass binding decrees over the whole Order, and is the only body which can grant or revoke the charters to establish a [[Madrasa]], or a [[Muasasa]].

### Madrasas

The main structural organ of the Magi is the [[Madrasa]], institutions of education, research, and significant economic activity. Here, students are inducted into the order and study various subjects, while accomplished Magi are supported in undertaking various projects, and technical and magical assistance is provided to local populations and governments in exchange for goodwill, influence, or other compensation.

Each Madrasa has a [[College of Sages]] which serves as main governing body, comprised of the senior scholars. Individual Madrasas differ in detail, but generally the Sages are elevated in annual ceremonies by a [[College of Eamids]], made up of the [[Eamid|Eamids]] in charge of each faculty. The College of Sages elects from among their number a [[Grand Sage]], the overall leader of the Madrasa. In most Madrasas, the Grand Sage fills ceremonial roles and represents the Madrasa externally, while a [[Grand Eamid]] (often elected by the College of Eamids) oversees regular day-to-day functions.

A Madrasa typically has a single primary campus, which varies in size and development, but additional satellite campuses, guild houses, or research institutes are not uncommon. The large majority of Magi working in a region will be doing so as members of their local Madrasa.

### Muasasas

[[Muasasa|Muasasas]] are institutes founded by the [[College of the Seven Sages]] to work independently of a given [[Madrasa]] and serve the Magi Order as a whole. The membership for a Muasasa is drawn from various Madrasas, but the Magi do not give up their previous associations and are still considered representatives of their particular Madrasa individually.

The Muasasas include:
 - [[Mahakim Altaftish]]: A court responsible for rooting out [[Sahir]] and other criminal elements within the Order, empowered to strip members of rank and [[Magi Keys|Keys]]. Their remit is to avoid embarrassments to the Order by dealing with problematic members internally.
 - [[Adawat Walqiasat]]: A council responsible for standardizing instruments and measurements.
 - [[Majlis Alsadaqa]]: A small foundation established to encourage knowledge sharing and academic cooperation between Madrasas.
 - [[Buhuth Almutaqadima]]: A secretive institute focused on advanced research and collection of powerful relics.

### Ranks

Aspirants enter the Order as [[Tulaab]], students of a Madrasa.

Once the Talib has completed a basic curriculum in all essential subjects, they are formally inducted as a [[Magi]]. At this stage, they are granted a [[Halqat Mafatih]], a large keyring often worn from the neck or on a sash around the waist. The material the ring is made from differs between Madrasas.

When a Magi has completed an advanced curriculum in a subject, culminating in an [[Utruha]] that contributes new understanding, they are elevated to the rank of [[Master]] in that subject. A Magi can become the Master of many different subjects. For each subject mastered, the Magi is given a [[Magi Keys|Key]] of a different material, to be worn on the [[Halqat Mafatih]]. This allows the well-educated Magi to, at a glance, identify the studiousness and specialties of one another.

[[Sage|Sages]] are high ranking scholars, generally inducted by their Madrasa's [[College of Eamids]]. It is conventional, but not mandatory, that only Masters are elevated to the position of [[Sage]]. While Masters may work for the Madrasa, or receive funds for various projects, only Sages are permitted to take apprentices and become lecturers.

[[Eamids]] are deans of a subject. They are typically Sages, elected by the sitting faculty of their subject. They set curricular specifics, oversee grading and evaluation, and distribute funds to projects.

The [[Grand Eamid]] is typically the day-to-day manager of a Madrasa as a whole, resolving matters of discipline and funding and appointing staff for basic functions like security or sanitation.

The [[Grand Sage]] is the formal leader of a Madrasa, and the highest rank of the Magi Order. The Grand Sages of all Madrasas are theoretical equals, though only the first seven sit on the [[College of the Seven Sages]], effectively making them a higher class.

## History

The Magi Order originally developed from the [[Apkallu]], seven ancient sages who learned secrets of magic and then dispersed to teach to other mortals away from the oversight of the [[Pari]] at the [[House of Wisdom]]. The circles of students and academics growing around each of the Apkallu would develop into the first seven [[Madrasa|Madrasas]].

The Magi were instrumental in aiding the mortal cause in the [[War of Fate]], but remained an obscure organisation until the ascension of [[Caliph Nasirpal I]], a member of the order, to the [[Lazurite Throne]] in 560 TK. Under Nasirpal, the Magi were formally confirmed as an [[Orders of the Mortal Empire|Order of the Mortal Empire]], granted legal status and protections equal to those of the [[Khatibi Order]], and quickly developed into a politically and economically influential institution of the [[Mortal Empire]], present at noble courts across the Empire.

## Subjects

The [[Madrasa|Madrasas]] of the Magi Order teach a wide variety of subjects. Not all are taught everywhere, and many of the Madrasas are seen to specialize in certain areas. The [[Magi Keys|Keys]] granted for Mastery of a subject are standardized across the Order, however.

A non-comprehensive list of subjects and their associated Keys includes:
