The **Fidai Order** are one of the three [[Orders of the Mortal Empire]]. They are an organization of hunters, assassins, and spies, as well as advisors, magicians, and travelling envoys. The formal responsibility of the Order is to hunt down [[Sahir]] and dangerous [[Monsters]], to protect common people in the [[Mortal Empire]], though their own goals and operations are often more complex.

The Fidai were founded by [[Abu Hamasat]], the so-called *Father of Whispers*, during the chaos of the [[Year of Four Caliphs]]. They were only granted official status as an Order over two hundred years later under [[Caliph Rawi]].

The Fidai operate across the [[Mortal Empire]] and beyond, but they are said to have a central base, the [[House of Whispers]]. The location of the House, if it indeed exists, is a secret even to many members of the Order.

It is common knowledge that the Father of Whispers recorded hundreds, or perhaps even thousands, of predictions and instructions for the future while he was still living. The details and scope of these predictions, and how far into the future they project, is less well known. Many of the Order's operations are ultimately in the interest of forwarding these mysterious past instructions.

## Organisation

The details of the Fidai Order's internal structure are not public information. Generally speaking, it is known that most enter the Order as an apprentice to a more senior member, who becomes their trainer and handler. Many never elevate beyond this stage, maintaining another public life while making occasional contributions to the Order.

The leaders of the Order are the [[Council of Listeners]], who read and interpret the words of [[Abu Hamasat]]. Their identities, and indeed their numbers, are unknown. The most public face of the Order is the [[Speaker of the Fidai]] who is responsible for answering for the actions of the Order to the [[Caliph]] and other major political figures. Additionally, many Caliphs and [[Sultan|Sultans]] will have a [[Court Assassin]] in their employ, who is often a member of the Order.
