The **Khatibi** are a large and diverse priestly organisation, and one of the three orders of the [[Mortal Empire]]. Practitioners of [[Al-Khatib]], the Khatibi record and honour the names and deeds of the [[Wali]], measure the status of [[Maat]], and render advice and aid to all levels of society. Khatibi speakers hold both political influence and spiritual power.

## Organisation

### Schools

The Khatibi Order is widespread and multifaceted. It is comprised of a number of different [[Khatibi Schools|Schools]], which differ in responsibilities, geographic distribution, and values.

 - The largest, the [[Erebiti School]] are a prestigious creed of priests who wear white robes. They are primarily responsible for the maintenance of [[Ziggurat|Ziggurats]] and other major holy places, the recording of the names and deeds of the [[Wali]], and the speaking of the names and natural laws.
 - The [[Naasiqi School]] are a creed of hermetic priests who wear grey and brown robes. In seclusion, they remember and reflect on the [[Wali]], spiritually connecting their power to distant and remote places, as well as offering aid and guidance to travelers.
 - The [[Qalbi School]] are a creed of priests who wear red robes. They are centered in the [[Great City of Aam]] where most of their number can be found, but some travel the [[Mortal Empire]] and beyond. The Qalbi are pacifistic and focus on bringing healing and aid to those in need.
 - The [[Earafi School]] are a creed of priests who wear gold robes, centered at the [[High Place of the Candle]]. Traditionally focused on divination through ingestion of the energy of the [[Wali]], the Earafi are also the most focused on measuring the status of [[Maat]].
 - The [[Haqiqi School]] are a creed of priests who wear blue robes, who are centered at a secret place referred to as the [[Zinzana]]. The Haqiqi are responsible for dealing with matters of curses, heresy, heathenry, and dealings with spirits and black magic. In the [[Mortal Empire]], they are legally empowered to make arrests on religious grounds, which can only be overturned by the authority of a [[Sultan]] or equivalent ranking authority.

### Structure

There is no single formal leader of the Khatibi Order, though in the [[Mortal Empire]] especially, *de facto* positions of authority have evolved. Each [[Sultan]] typically appoints a [[Rishama]] to serve amongst their closest advisors, and that priest will naturally assume a politically significant role as representative of the Order at Court. The [[Caliph]] will also, similarly, appoint a [[High Priest]], who becomes a first-among-equals in the high ranking priesthood.

On matters of significance, all the high ranking priests of a place will gather for a council, where matters are decided by exhaustive debate until unanimity can be reached.

All members of the priesthood are called [[Khatib]], a rank which grants the authority to call on the names of the [[Wali]], which is restricted from the secular servants of the Order. Khatib are appointed to their position, typically from among the servants, by a [[Hemet]].

The [[Hemet|Hemets]] are higher priests with a level of authority and oversight. One becomes a Hemet in a secretive ceremony which must be performed by two existing Hemets. Many Hemets serve as religious leaders for a temple or other population center, while some serve other administrative roles within the Order or its Schools.

Finally, the [[Entu]] are the highest regular rank of priesthood. They are only appointed by elections of a council of Hemets, typically to serve as an authority for a specific purpose. Their particular authority and restrictions are recorded on an [[Entu Stone]] which is generally hung around the neck.

There are some variations in practice by region or School. For example, in the [[Earafi School]], a single formal leader is recognizedâ€”the [[Heirophant]], who is regarded by the rest of the Order as an [[Entu]] of particular significance.

## Beliefs and Practices

The Khatibi practice [[Al-Khatib]], a form of ancestor worship which elevates particularly significant and holy mortals as [[Wali]]. Their names and deeds are recorded and remembered, and called on to summon power in times of need.

The form of magic practiced by the Khatibi is formally called [[Invocation]]. It uses the power of names, as well as calling on the ancient natural laws set down by the [[True Gods]], to command existence to conform to the speaker's will.
