The **Caliph** is the ultimate steward of all creations of the [[True Gods]]. When they passed from the world, the [[Djinn]] [[Sakhr]] was granted the title, as well as [[Supreme Cosmic Authority]], through the [[Tablet of Destinies]].

## Mortal Caliphs

Following the [[War of Fate]], the shattering of the Tablet, and the establishment of the [[Mortal Empire]], a mortal ruler adopted the title and assumed its cosmic power and responsibilities. The temporal lord of the Mortal Empire, the Caliph also assumes great spiritual burdens keeping the principles of [[Maat]] aligned, demanding that all holders of the title are powerful wills and proficient wielders of magical power.

The Caliphate of the Mortal Empire is typically passed down to the selected heir of the previous holder of the title, usually (but not always) a powerful member of their dynasty.
