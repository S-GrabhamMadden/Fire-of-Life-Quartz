The **Caliph** is the ultimate steward of all creations of the [[True Gods]]. When they passed from the world, the [[Djinn]] [[Sakhr]] was granted the title, as well as [[Supreme Cosmic Authority]], through the [[Tablet of Destinies]].

## Mortal Caliphs

Following the [[War of Fate]], the shattering of the Tablet, and the establishment of the [[Mortal Empire]], a mortal ruler adopted the title and assumed its cosmic power and responsibilities. The temporal lord of the Mortal Empire, the Caliph also assumes great spiritual burdens keeping the principles of [[Maat]] aligned, demanding that all holders of the title are powerful wills and proficient wielders of magical power.

The Caliphate of the [[Mortal Empire]] is typically passed down to the selected heir of the previous holder of the title, usually (but not always) a powerful member of their dynasty. At times, particularly in periods of danger or social tension, the succession has been decided by [[Mubaraza]], a form of traditional duel between claimants.

## List of Caliphs

| Caliph/Calipha                                 | Reign                    | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Sakhr]]                                      | (888 Years)              | The Master of the [[Djinn]] and tyrannical emperor of the world, overthrown in the [[War of Fate]]. Though he held the title of Caliph, Sakhr is not often counted among their number by [[Khatibi Order]] record-keepers.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Caliph Ezim]]                                | 0-111 TK (111 Years)     | First Mortal Caliph, said to be one of the most powerful mortal sorcerers in history. Ezim was a leading figure in the [[War of Fate]] and is closely associated with the [[Maat]] principle of Truth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Caliph Shakush]]                             | 111-221 TK (110 Years)   | *The Builder*. Shakush engineered the construction of the [[Qasr]] as well as a number of [[High Place\|High Places]]. Shakush also relaxed the restrictions on [[Beings/Spirits/index\|Spirits]] remaining in the [[Mortal Empire]], and is closely associated with the [[Maat]] principle of Harmony.                                                                                                                             |
| [[Caliph Suzub]]                               | 221-320 TK (99 Years)    | *The Lawgiver*. Suzub governed over a turbulent century including the first [[Qaf War\|war]] with the [[Div]] of the northeast, but is most remembered for laying out the [[Suzubi Code]], the set of foundational laws in force to this day in the Empire. Suzub is closely associated with the [[Maat]] principle of Balance.                                                                                                     |
| [[Calipha Wahda]]                              | 320-386 TK (66 Years)    | Calipha Wahda was formerly a soldier, and significantly expanded the [[Caliph's Haras]] into a functional army. She oversaw the [[Border Wars]] which seized [[Musur]] and [[Qalea]], and is closely associated with the [[Maat]] principle of Order.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Calipha Karama]]                             | 386-390 TK (4 Years)     | Karama granted rights and liberties to the [[Zouhri]] at the same time as granting power to the [[Khatibi Order]] Order—which spearheaded the removal of Spiritual influence and the deification of the past Caliphs and other [[Wali]] in place of the [[True Gods]]. Karama is closely associated with the [[Maat]] principle of Morality.                                                                                        |
| [[Caliph Bav Ilim]]                            | 390-405 TK (15 Years)    | Bav Ilim was a leader of the [[Shakhs Mukhli]], a militant religious movement which opposed the Khatibi and the supplantation of the True Gods. He seized power in a duel with Calipha Karama, and reigned over a period of intense religious conflict, the [[Apostasy]].                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Calipha Amat]]                               | 405-414 TK (9 Years)     | Calipha Amat, a ranking [[Khatibi Order]] speaker, defeated Caliph Bav Ilim in a duel much similar to that in which he came to power, ensuring the victory of the [[Khatibi Order]] Order over the [[Shakhs Mukhli]] in the [[Apostasy]].                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Caliph Huzalu]]                              | 414-422 TK (8 Years)     | *The Gazelle*. The son of Calipha Amat, Huzalu is most remembered for his extravagance and fits of whimsy. After eight years of his reign, he abdicated and granted the Caliphate to a farmer who he met during a disguised tour of the western Sultanates.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Caliph Zeru]]                                | 422-443 TK (21 Years)    | *The Farmer*. A wheat farmer of [[Hanhar]] who hosted Caliph Huzalu in disguise, Zeru struggled with the cosmic weight of the title, but in fact excelled in the temporal responsibilities of Caliph, bringing prosperity to common people.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| *[[Althunayiya\|The Althunayiya]]*             | 443-453 TK (10 Years)    | Immediately preceding the death of Caliph Zeru, two rival claimants to the throne were granted permission to share the title as joint Caliphs, [[Caliph Mansor\|Mansor]] and [[Calipha Mahnoush\|Mahnoush]].  This was and remains a source of much scholarly debate as to counting the holders of the title.                                                                                                                       |
| *[[War of Six Crowns\|The War of Six Crowns]]* | 453-455 TK (2 Years)     | Following the death of [[Mansor]], a conflict to replace his position in the dual Caliphate spiralled into a disastrous civil war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Calipha Qunnabatu]]                          | 455-560 TK (105 Years)   | Qunnabatu, notably the only Caliph to have originated from the Southern Sultanates, was the victor of the [[War of Six Crowns]]. Remembered as a powerful and wealthy ruler, she also oversaw the [[Scourging of Sawat]] and the end of the [[Bandit Kingdom of Sawat\|Bandit Kingdom]] that had arisen on that island.                                                                                                             |
| [[Caliph Nasirpal I]]                          | 560-591 TK (31 Years)    | Remembered well for his raw ambition, Nasirpal I seized the throne in a traditional duel with Qunnabatu's chosen heir [[Barsip]]. A member of the [[Magi Order]], Nasirpal I was one of the most powerful sorcerers in history. His patronage greatly expanded the political influence of the [[Magi Order\|Magi]], leading to their presence in many high courts.                                                                  |
| [[Caliph Nasirpal II]]                         | 591-671 TK (80 Years)    | Nasirpal II is a fondly remembered prodigy and scholar, who made many personal contributions to sciences and magic. In some contemporary texts he is recorded as the *daughter* of Nasirpal I, though he assumed the masculine title of Caliph (and his father's name) upon his ascension.                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Caliph Nasirpal III]]                        | 671-676 TK (5 Years)     | The son of Nasirpal II was hoped to follow the pattern of his predecessors, but is remembered today as an indulgent wastrel and a scoundrel. Five years into his reign, Nasirpal III was assassinated by members of his own [[Caliph's Haras\|Haras]].                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Calipha Mullissu]]                           | 676-676 TK (0 Years)     | *The Timid*. Mullissu, a distant cousin of the Narsipal dynasty, was crowned in a rushed ceremony by the conspirators of Narsipal III's assassination, the [[Inner Circle]]. Although magically capable, Mullissu is recorded as intensely anxious, and abdicated only a few weeks later on her first journey outside the Qasr as Calipha.                                                                                          |
| [[Caliph Monobazus]]                           | 676-676 TK (0 Years)     | *The Alchemist-King*. [[Lugal]] of [[Irgal]], Monobazus was a recluse, though one of few known sorcerers powerful enough to serve as Caliph in the immediate aftermath of Narsipal III's assassination. He led a [[Restoration League\|combined army]] to the Qasr and arrested the Inner Circle, governing for a month and a day before identifying an appropriate replacement and promptly abdicating to her.                     |
| [[Calipha Agerzama]]                           | 676-785 TK (109 Years)   | *The Cheetah*. Agerzama, a woman from the east of [[Musur]], whose family in fact originated from further east still, was selected by Monobazus purely for her magical capabilities. She proved a tenacious commander and shrewd diplomat, restoring some stability to the [[Mortal Empire]] and greatly improving its standing.                                                                                                    |
| [[Caliph Ahar]]                                | 785-862 TK (77 Years)    | *The Lion*. Ahar was the son of Agerzama, and while missing some of her tact and arcane power, was no less proficient at war. He led a large Imperial army to success in the [[War of the River]] against [[Mazandaran]] and its allies.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[The Mad Caliph]]                             | 862-881 TK (19 Years)    | All records and histories of the Mad Caliph, his times and his deeds, have been struck and destroyed, in an attempt to eradicate his memory and therefore banish his soul from the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Caliph Rawi]]                                | 881-894 TK (13 Years)    | *The Poet*. A [[Sha'ir]] of the [[House of Wisdom]], and an accomplished poet and artist, Rawi led a short artistic revolution. The [[Council of Nine]], a group of influential power brokers which had also brought about the demise of the Mad Caliph, forced Rawi to abdicate for his close associations with the [[Pari]].                                                                                                      |
| *[[Khului\|The Khului]]*                       | 894-897 TK (3 Years)     | Following the demise of the Mad Caliph and the forced abdication of Caliph Rawi, the [[Council of Nine]] attempted to seize control directly and govern as an order of regents around an empty throne. This situation lasted three years before the destructive effect on [[Maat]] led the Council to dissolve and support a new Caliph.                                                                                            |
| [[Caliph Mannan]]                              | 897-925 TK (28 Years)    | *The Golden*. Mannan was a member of the [[Council of Nine]], as well as the [[Five Hundred Lords of Tharwa]]. A merchant lord who dominated the [[Coffee]] trade, Mannan was the richest man in history, and obtained the Caliphate by buying the title from the other eight Councilors. He surprised his subjects with generosities during his reign which went so far as to devalue gold in the towns he visited.                |
| [[Calipha Ibti I]]                             | 925-960 TK (35 Years)    | Ibti was a beautiful woman and a concubine of Caliph Mannan. He gifted her the Caliphate to show her his favor, and she governed for three and a half decades of relative peace and prosperity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Caliph Ibti II]]                             | 960-968 TK (8 Years)     | Son of Calipha Ibti I, Ibti II had little of his mother's practicality and was widely regarded as a brave fool. He led an unprepared army into the east, the ill-fated [[Bhanwadia Campaign]], and was killed leading a group of forward scouts away from his main force.                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Caliph Safar]]                               | 968-999 TK (31 Years)    | *The Voyager*. An avid explorer who sourced power from many ancient discoveries, Safar continued to mount expeditions to far away treasuries and [[High Place\|High Places]] throughout his reign. In 997, he outfitted a fleet and sailed westwards, in search of [[Jabulsa]]. His fleet never returned, sparking a crisis to replace him.                                                                                         |
| [[Calipha Raina]]                              | 1000-1055 TK (55 Years)  | Raina was the victor of the [[Grand Mubaraza]], held on the eve of the 1,000th anniversary of the Mortal Empire. Formerly a [[Sahir]], she remained a practitioner of dark magics, and cracked down on the rights of [[Beings/Spirits/index\|Spirits]] and [[Zouhri]]. In her 55th year of rule, she was assassinated by an unknown group. Many suspect, without evidence, the involvement of the [[Fidai\|Fidai Order]].           |
| [[Caliph Sahm]]                                | 1055-1099 TK (44 Years)  | Caliph Sahm, son of Raina, reversed the worst of his mother's excesses and ruled as a moderate—although also doing much to reinforce the security of the Caliph and the [[Qasr]] itself, and greatly increasing the size of the [[Caliph's Haras]].                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Caliph Alsaqr]]                              | 1099-1311 TK (212 Years) | Alsaqr, son of Sahm, was by far the longest reigning of all mortal Caliphs. He grew cruel and paranoid in his age, directly sparking the [[Imperial Civil War]]. 212 years into his reign, he was revealed as having made agreements with the [[Ifrit]] to extinguish the [[Fire of Life]] in exchange for eternal rule over the dead in [[Kur]]. Alsaqr was vanquished by the [[Lanternbearers]] in a battle deep under the earth. |
| *[[New Khului\|The New Khului]]*               | 1311-1317 TK (6 Years)   | Following Caliph Alsaqr's demise, the [[Imperial Civil War]] did not resolve immediately. The remaining rival claimants continue to fight a slowed conflict for control over the realm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
