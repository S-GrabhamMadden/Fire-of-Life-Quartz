**Khedive** is a title used by high-ranking territorial governors appointed by the [[Caliph]] to rule an area of the [[Mortal Empire]], called a [[Khedivate]]. Two such titles currently exist:

 - [[Sawat]] is governed by a Khedive, but is otherwise largely autonomous and largely treated as an equal to the [[Sultan|Sultans]].
 - [[Sharaq]] is a military territory in the [[Eastern Frontier]], governed as a forward bulwark for the [[Mortal Empire]].
