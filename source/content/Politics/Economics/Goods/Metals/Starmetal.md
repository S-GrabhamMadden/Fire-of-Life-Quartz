**Starmetal** denotes a range of metallic alloys that come from fallen stars. It is purported to have a variety of beneficial properties, depending largely on astrological associations. It is most prized by alchemists and astrologers, particularly among the [[Magi Order]], who have also mastered the difficult process of working the metal, but it can be found in use in small amounts across the world.
