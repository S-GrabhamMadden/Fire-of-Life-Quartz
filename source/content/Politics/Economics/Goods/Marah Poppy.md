**Marah Poppy**, sometimes called *Sirens Kiss*, is a flowering plant, grown mostly in the [[Southern Sultanates]] and southern parts of the [[Eastern Realms]], such as [[Kandaravat]]. The Poppy is used to produce [[Poppy Milk]], an addictive dried latex with strong painkilling and intoxicating properties, used both medicinally and recreationally. Its recreational use is euphemistically referred to as the [[Southern Habit]].
